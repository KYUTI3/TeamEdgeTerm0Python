 #  Team Edge List Mini-project: FOR LOOP CHALLENGES
 # 
 #   Complete the following loop challenges below. Follow the ToDos
 #   1. COUNTER: Write a loop that prints a happy birthday message for every
 #      year you have been alive.
 #   2. ITERATOR: Write a for for loop that prints every item in a list

 #   3. EVEN COUNTDOWN: Write a for loop that counts down from 100 to 0, 
 #      printing only the odd numers
 #   4. FINDER: Write a function that takes in a list and a word and prints 
 #      CONGRATULATIONS!! if the word is found in the list
 #   5. NESTED: Write a function that logs every letter in a sentence
